# Personal Thermoregulator
When you wear this device, it makes you feel the environment colder by -probably- tricking your mind. 
To do this, it cools down your inner wrist at regular intervals by using a peltier module. When your inner wrist gets cooler, you actually feel the environment is cooler.

## Schematics
You need to set this circuit up, on a Wemos d1 mini protoboard shield. It's a bit tricky, I'll draw a proper printable pcb soon.

## Thanks
I learned about this cooling effect thanks to an old startup called Wristify (I think they are called Embr Labs now). I'd like to thank them for the inspiration. I made several devices like this over the years, but this one is working great!
